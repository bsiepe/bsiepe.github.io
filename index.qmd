<!-- I am passionate about the open science movement and have been actively involved in the local open science groups in Frankfurt and Marburg.

If possible, I publish all my projects with open data and code. -->

I am a Doctoral student in Psychological Methods at the [University of Marburg, Germany](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/fb04/team-heck/team/bjoern-siepe). <br> 
My research focuses on three areas: metascience of methodological research (particularly simulation studies), time series models for psychological time series, and applied experience sampling research. I'm interested in understanding how we can make methodological research more robust and transparent, and how we can better model intensive longitudinal data.


I'm committed to open science practices. Together with collaborators, I built [openESM](https://openesmdata.org), an open-source database of 60+ experience sampling datasets. I'm also a board member of the [Open Science Initiative](https://openscienceinitiativeuniversitymarburg.github.io/) at Marburg University. You can find my projects with open data and code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bsiepe). <br>

For questions or a chat, feel free to [contact me](mailto:bjoernsiepe@gmail.com). My full publication list is in my [CV](../cv).
